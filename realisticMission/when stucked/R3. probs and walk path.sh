!#/hts/realistic/3/

for the traversal attack, I've tried triple wordlist, 
  common.txt included by gobuster
  common.txt & commonPath.txt by secList project(starred this repositoryï¼‰
  but only /bg found, it's a background image, lead me to shit

for review the comment, found oldindex.html by our kid, 
  he remade current index.html via vulnerable submit function

solution: we confirmed the poems are saved as file in rewrite modes only, we remade html via this vulnerable function

bizzard part like !#/hts/basic/dunnoWho index.html are located as ../index.html, nobody fooking know why our millennium hackers 
thinking...
back to that age, I'm hacking dearest windows XP to gain access to play some video game... ; )
