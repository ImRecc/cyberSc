oldindex.html
submit sector, ssi injection?
common one are not respone and may not been executed from server side.. 
<!#exec command ='ls'> just been uploaded and nothing special happen, no running no error check...

fine, I have to learn more about two injection techniques, and the directory traversal either

for the traversal, still no go on it cause the lucky part not come yet

a minutes before traversal, I simply spotted there was a oldindex.html and the info just lied down on the page 
and our hacker %> just remade new one to current index.html..

#!/hts/realistic/3/oldindex.html -> !# /hts/realistic/3/newindex.html 
so there is no traversal attack?
traversal attack performing but low hope, might just another bg.jpg or something..
