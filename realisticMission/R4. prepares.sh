R4. meat butcher here 
trade from some kind gentle animal activist..
  
  R4-G1. e-mail lists of customers..
two pages of product category..
only one e-mail provider input box on the index.html

injection: SQL injection. Structured Query Language for our email list query attack of course

not counting on the stupid and hopeless directory traversal attack

however, they have some input sanitize security

yes, bypassing the formate check

sql injection exist,
we found that mail list could be shown in it's grocery page, cause they both use sql query command
SQL uniq. but I couldn't focus
