#!/accessControl

vertical privilege escalation like change the role or authentical to view some path
horizontal privilege escalation like a user could access other users' folder '

but all those happen only on verification...

a interesting thing about two-factor verification: when a user passed login and verification, a token or mark granted,
than, attacker can bypass two-factor verification too

#!/server-side authentical forgery, interesting way to bypass the verification

#!/fileUploadVulnerabilities in apprentice level, zero verification or user-controllable verification not a prob anymore

#!/OSCommandInjection nothing special for a non-protected place, but & is a shell command seperator

#!/SQLinjection with UNION key work, we should determine how many colum contain and full with NULL.
