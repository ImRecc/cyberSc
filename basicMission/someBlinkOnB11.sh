so we have an apache webpage that auto-display a formated message with music names..
I have tried to figure out if there is *.list.txt or *.mp3 or folder..
and I believe that by the name of our Network Sam, there must be a .key file or psw file in the sever...

directory-level configuration file .. Apache..

we tried every where through the .htaccess file
but when we occasionally spotted the web directory scanner like dirBurster, we do find /b11/e/l/t/o/n/.htaccess 
"the password is somewhere closer! try harder?"

.. yes, somewhere closer!
